        <p id="tribute-info">Here's a time line of Ho Chi Minh's life:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>1890-1911</b> - Born in 1890 into a patriotic family in Nghe An, Ho Chi Minh (originally Nguyễn Sinh
                Cung, later Nguyễn Tất Thành and Nguyễn Ái Quốc) developed a strong sense of patriotism early on.
                Witnessing the harsh realities of French colonial rule and the failures of existing resistance
                movements, he became convinced that a new revolutionary path was needed to liberate Vietnam. Driven by
                an intense desire to save his country, he decided to travel abroad to learn from other nations before
                returning to lead his people to independence.</li>
            <li><b>1911-1920</b> - In 1911, Ho Chi Minh left Vietnam for France to pursue his revolutionary aspirations.
                He traveled extensively across continents from 1911 to 1917, observing the suffering under colonialism
                and realizing that exploited people worldwide shared a common struggle against imperialist oppressors.
                In 1919, as Nguyễn Ái Quốc, he joined the French Socialist Party and submitted the "Demands of the
                Annamese People" to the Versailles Conference, advocating for Vietnamese rights and emphasizing
                self-reliance for liberation. A pivotal moment came in July 1920 when he read Lenin's "Theses on the
                National and Colonial Questions," which profoundly clarified the path to liberation for Vietnam through
                the proletarian revolution. This led him to embrace Leninism, becoming the first Vietnamese communist
                and forging a powerful synthesis of patriotism, internationalism, and the pursuit of national
                independence aligned with socialism.</li>
            <li><b>1920-1930</b> - From 1922, Ho Chi Minh, as Nguyễn Ái Quốc, actively fought against colonialism. He
                co-founded the Union of Colonial Peoples and launched Le Paria to expose colonial injustices. In 1925,
                his book French Colonialism on Trial further denounced French rule. He established the Vietnamese
                Revolutionary Youth League in Guangzhou, training cadres and publishing Thanh Niên to disseminate
                Marxist-Leninist ideas, which were codified in his 1927 work, Đường Cách mệnh.

                He consistently emphasized the need for a strong political organization to lead the revolution. In 1930,
                he unified three communist groups to form the Communist Party of Vietnam. The Party's first Political
                Platform, largely drafted by him, creatively applied Marxism-Leninism to Vietnam's unique context,
                marking a crucial turning point that guided the nation towards independence and socialism and ended the
                crisis in revolutionary leadership.</li>
            <li><b>1930-1945</b> - The Communist Party of Vietnam, founded in 1930, immediately led the 1930-1931
                revolutionary wave, including the Nghe Tinh Soviets, with Ho Chi Minh coordinating international support
                and criticizing Party weaknesses. Although the Party briefly changed its name to the "Indochinese
                Communist Party" in October 1930 following Comintern directives, Ho Chi Minh maintained significant
                influence, continuing his studies at the Lenin International School.

                After years of revolutionary work abroad, enduring hardships, he returned to Vietnam on January 28,
                1941. Under his leadership, the Eighth Central Committee Conference in May 1941 prioritized national
                liberation, establishing the Viet Minh Front on May 19, 1941, and later the Vietnam Propaganda and
                Liberation Army (December 22, 1944). His call for a General Uprising on August 18, 1945, led to the
                successful August Revolution, overthrowing colonial and feudal rule. Finally, on September 2, 1945, Ho
                Chi Minh delivered the Declaration of Independence, establishing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and
                affirming the nation's right to freedom and independence, a vision he had laid out since the Party's
                1930 platform.</li>
            <li><b>1945-1969</b> - After gaining power, President Ho Chi Minh led the Vietnamese people to overcome many
                difficulties, fighting against the invasion of French colonialism and then American imperialism. He
                combined armed struggle with skillful diplomacy, consolidated the government, built the Party, and
                launched a long-term resistance war for all people. He proposed the path of building socialism in the
                North, fighting to liberate the South, and unifying the country. In his Will before he passed away
                (1969), he affirmed his belief in the victory of the nation and called for the building of a peaceful,
                independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam. His life and career are a shining example for
                generations to follow.</li>
